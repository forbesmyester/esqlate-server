## To install this project

### Starting a local, sample database.

First you need a PostgreSQL database, My favourite way to get a locally running PostgreSQL server is to create a simple `docker-compose.yml` file per project:

```
echo '
version: "3"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:11.4
    environment:
    - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"
    volumes:
    - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes: 
  postgres-data:' > docker-compose.yaml
```

### Import a sample data set

Then import a sample data set (in this case, Microsoft's Northwind dataset converted into PostgreSQL).

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pthom/northwind_psql/5f9ba34aa1d980392685042037b0b1112d01bd32/northwind.sql | psql

### Create a definition for a query you wish to run

Next, create a definition file. These definition files are like templates for queries.

```bash

mkdir -p definition
echo '
    {
        "name": "customer_search",
        "title": "Customer Search",
        "description": "List customers using a substring search",
        "variables": [{ "name": "search_string", "variable_type": "string" }],
        "statement": "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE LOWER(company_name) LIKE CONCAT('"'%'"', LOWER($search_string), '"'%'"') OR LOWER(contact_name) LIKE CONCAT('"'%'"', LOWER($search_string), '"'%'"')"
    }' > definition/customer_search.json

```

### Lastly start the service

You are no ready to start the service:

```bash
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=postgres
export PGHOST=127.0.0.1
export PGDATABASE=postgres

export DEFINITION_DIRECTORY="$PWD/definition"
export ADVERTISED_API_ROOT=http://localhost:8803 # This can cause issues with redirects in browsers. Using `/` fixes the problem, but I like full URL locations.
export LISTEN_PORT=8803

npm run-script build
npm start
```
## Testing the API

The most basic thing you can do is get a definition:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8803/definition/customer_search
```


Suppose you want to do something useful however, such as actually run the query:

```bash
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    --data '[{ "field_name": "search_string", "field_value": "Simon" }]' \
    http://localhost:8803/request/customer_search
```

The output of this will look similar to the following

```bash
> POST /request/customer_search HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8803
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Type: application/json
> Content-Length: 59
>
* upload completely sent off: 59 out of 59 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
< X-Powered-By: Express
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Location: /request/customer_search/oDzS9suv
< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
< Content-Length: 48
< ETag: W/"30-K4lHAC8iwpUSjSDR/g3P1KLFAUU"
< Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:35:24 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
<
{"location":"http:/localhost:8803/request/customer_search/Uz9rkntC
```


Using the above URL will allow you to monitor the request:

```bash
curl -v http:/localhost:8803/request/customer_search/Uz9rkntC
```

It is likely that your request has already completed giving you the result below, but Esqlate is designed as a Queue based system so the system administrator has some degree of control how much load you wish to put on your PostgreSQL server. If it has not yet completed you will get the resonse  `{ "status": "pending" }` and will need to re-issue the request.

```bash
> GET /request/customer_search/uQEnGH1z HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8803
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
< X-Powered-By: Express
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Location: http:/localhost:8803/result/customer_search/uQEnGH1zDLaT
< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
< Content-Length: 91
< ETag: W/"5b-3tdNMonceUSkJklVx8nakJZihfY"
< Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:39:48 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
<
{"status":"complete","location":"http:/localhost:8803/result/customer_search/Uz9rkntC9reP"}
```

Now you know that the request is complete and the location of the final result, you can go ahead and simply get the result:

```bash
curl http:/localhost:8803/result/customer_search/Uz9rkntC9reP
```

```json
{
  "fields": [
    { "field_name": "customer_id", "field_type": "bpchar" },
    { "field_name": "company_name", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "contact_name", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "contact_title", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "address", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "city", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "region", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "postal_code", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "country", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "phone", "field_type": "varchar" },
    { "field_name": "fax", "field_type": "varchar" }
  ],
  "rows": [
    [
      "NORTS",
      "North/South",
      "Simon Crowther",
      "Sales Associate",
      "South House 300 Queensbridge",
      "London",
      null,
      "SW7 1RZ",
      "UK",
      "(171) 555-7733",
      "(171) 555-2530"
    ],
    [
      "SIMOB",
      "Simons bistro",
      "Jytte Petersen",
      "Owner",
      "VinbÃ¦ltet 34",
      "Kobenhavn",
      null,
      "1734",
      "Denmark",
      "31 12 34 56",
      "31 13 35 57"
    ]
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}
```
